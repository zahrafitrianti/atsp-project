[Critical] <Implicit_Intent> Implicit Service Checking:
           To ensure your app is secure, always use an explicit intent when starting a Service and DO NOT declare intent filters for your
           services. Using an implicit intent to start a service is a security hazard because you cannot be certain what service will
           respond to the intent, and the user cannot see which service starts.
           Reference: http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters.html#Types
               => com.service.mainService
[Critical]  AndroidManifest Critical Use Permission Checking:

[Warning]  AndroidManifest Exported Components Checking:
           Found "exported" components(except for Launcher) for receiving outside applications' actions (AndroidManifest.xml).
           These components can be initilized by other apps. You should add or modify the attribute to [exported="false"] if you don't want
           to.
           You can also protect it with a customized permission with "signature" or higher protectionLevel and specify in
           "android:permission" attribute.
                  service => com.service.mainService
[Notice]  AndroidManifest Adb Backup Checking:
           ADB Backup is ENABLED for this app (default: ENABLED). ADB Backup is a good tool for backing up all of your files. If it's open
           for this app, people who have your phone can copy all of the sensitive data for this app in your phone (Prerequisite: 1.Unlock
           phone's screen 2.Open the developer mode). The sensitive data may include lifetime access token, username or password, etc.
