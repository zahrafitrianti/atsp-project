[Critical] <Command> Runtime Command Checking:
           This app is using critical function 'Runtime.getRuntime().exec("...")'.
           Please confirm these following code secions are not harmful:
               => Lcom/android/system/q;->a(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String; (0x5a) --->
                    Ljava/lang/Runtime;->exec(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Process;
[Critical] <Implicit_Intent> Implicit Service Checking:
           To ensure your app is secure, always use an explicit intent when starting a Service and DO NOT declare intent filters for your
           services. Using an implicit intent to start a service is a security hazard because you cannot be certain what service will
           respond to the intent, and the user cannot see which service starts.
           Reference: http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters.html#Types
               => com.android.system.AndroidGuardianship
[Critical]  AndroidManifest Critical Use Permission Checking:
           This app has very high privileges. Use it carefully.
               Critical use-permission found: "android.permission.MOUNT_UNMOUNT_FILESYSTEMS"
[Warning]  Dynamic Code Loading:
           Dynamic code loading(DexClassLoader) found:
               => Lcom/android/system/a;-><init>(Landroid/content/Context; Ljava/lang/String;)V (0x8c) --->
                    Ldalvik/system/DexClassLoader;-><init>(Ljava/lang/String; Ljava/lang/String; Ljava/lang/String;

               => Lcom/android/system/a;-><init>(Landroid/content/Context; Ljava/lang/String;)V (0xdc) --->
                    Ldalvik/system/DexClassLoader;->loadClass(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Class;
[Warning]  External Storage Accessing:
           External storage access found (Remember DO NOT write important files to external storages):
               => Lcom/android/system/q;->d()Ljava/lang/String; (0x1c) --->
                    Landroid/os/Environment;->getExternalStorageDirectory()Ljava/io/File;
               => Lcom/android/system/q;->f()J (0x20) ---> Landroid/os/Environment;->getExternalStorageDirectory()Ljava/io/File;
[Warning]  AndroidManifest Exported Components Checking:
           Found "exported" components(except for Launcher) for receiving outside applications' actions (AndroidManifest.xml).
           These components can be initilized by other apps. You should add or modify the attribute to [exported="false"] if you don't want
           to.
           You can also protect it with a customized permission with "signature" or higher protectionLevel and specify in
           "android:permission" attribute.
                  service => com.android.system.AndroidGuardianship
[Warning] <Sensitive_Information> Getting IMEI and Device ID:
           This app has code getting the "device id(IMEI)" but there are problems with this "TelephonyManager.getDeviceId()" approach.
           1.Non-phones: Wifi-only devices or music players that don't have telephony hardware just don't have this kind of unique
           identifier.
           2.Persistence: On devices which do have this, it persists across device data wipes and factory resets. It's not clear at all if,
           in this situation, your app should regard this as the same device.
           3.Privilege:It requires READ_PHONE_STATE permission, which is irritating if you don't otherwise use or need telephony.
           4.Bugs: We have seen a few instances of production phones for which the implementation is buggy and returns garbage, for example
           zeros or asterisks.
           If you want to get an unique id for the device, we suggest you use "Installation" framework in the following article.
           Please check the reference: http://android-developers.blogspot.tw/2011/03/identifying-app-installations.html
               => Lcom/android/system/AGApp;->f()Ljava/lang/String; (0x22) --->
                    Landroid/telephony/TelephonyManager;->getDeviceId()Ljava/lang/String;
               => Lcom/android/system/AGApp;->h()V (0x10) ---> Landroid/telephony/TelephonyManager;->getDeviceId()Ljava/lang/String;
[Warning] <Sensitive_Information> Getting ANDROID_ID:
           This app has code getting the 64-bit number "Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID".
           ANDROID_ID seems a good choice for a unique device identifier. There are downsides: First, it is not 100% reliable on releases of
           Android prior to 2.2 (Froyo).
           Also, there has been at least one widely-observed bug in a popular handset from a major manufacturer, where every instance has
           the same ANDROID_ID.
           If you want to get an unique id for the device, we suggest you use "Installation" framework in the following article.
           Please check the reference: http://android-developers.blogspot.tw/2011/03/identifying-app-installations.html
               => Lcom/android/system/AGApp;->f()Ljava/lang/String; (0x72) --->
                    Landroid/provider/Settings$Secure;->getString(Landroid/content/ContentResolver; Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;
[Notice]  AndroidManifest Adb Backup Checking:
           ADB Backup is ENABLED for this app (default: ENABLED). ADB Backup is a good tool for backing up all of your files. If it's open
           for this app, people who have your phone can copy all of the sensitive data for this app in your phone (Prerequisite: 1.Unlock
           phone's screen 2.Open the developer mode). The sensitive data may include lifetime access token, username or password, etc.

[Notice]  File Unsafe Delete Checking:
           Everything you delete may be recovered by any user or attacker, especially rooted devices.
           Please make sure do not use "file.delete()" to delete essential files.

               => Lcom/android/system/q;->f(Ljava/lang/String;)Z (0x24) ---> Ljava/io/File;->delete()Z
[Notice]  HttpURLConnection Android Bug Checking:
           You're using "HttpURLConnection". Prior to Android 2.2 (Froyo), "HttpURLConnection" had some frustrating bugs.
           In particular, calling close() on a readable InputStream could poison the connection pool. Work around this by disabling
           connection pooling.
           Please check the reference:
